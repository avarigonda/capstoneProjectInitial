### Project Title

**Author**

#### Executive summary
This is a data analysis for the household power consumption with the daily average usage of global power consumption over a time for two calander years from December 2006 to December 2008. Here there is a testing and train data split with a 50% test size and using Grid Search hyperparameter in analysising this data. There is the comparision using randionForestRegression and multiple regression with several independent variable to see the difference with actual and prediction. Then a pairplot with a graphes that compares all the hyperparemeters. It is also important to see the correlation with the other variables with global active power so their is a heatmap that shows the correlations.  

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Anyone should care because we need to know the way how the power is exactly used for electric, gas and oil companies to have a better picuture and understanding of how households consume electric during a certain time of the year such a

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?
How a active power consumption in households is used throughout the year and how can we make sure this data is useful for energy companies?


#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
household_power_consumption.csv

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
The methods I am using is the RandomForestRegression with multiple regression along with gridsearchCV to see the errors. This will show how the data tests and train, showing the actual and prediction of the usage of global active power. And since the data shows every minute of every day used daily average of the all the variables excluding time to make assessments on this. 

#### Results
The research found that with RandomForestRegression using mutliple independent variable the power consumption is used more in the beginning and ending of the calender which indicates that it is based on the season and the predicted values does factor that. 

#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps?
It is the investigate more with the accuraty, testing, and training this data does and show how it can be useful for energy conpanies to process global active power consumption for a household data. And also investigation the other components of the data to see how it factors with global active power consumption.
